# Air-Canvas
Virtual Drawing 

The project takes advantage of this gap and focuses on developing a motion-to-text converter that can potentially serve as software for intelligent wearable 
devices for writing from the air. This project is a reporter of occasional gestures. It will use computer vision to trace the path of the finger. The generated text can also 
be used for various purposes, such as sending messages, emails, etc. It will be a powerful means of communication for the deaf. It is an effective communication method that reduces mobile and laptop 
usage by eliminating the need to write.
